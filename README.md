## Software Requirement 
- Python 3, NumPy, and pandas installed using Anaconda
- Text editor, like Sublime or Atom.
- A terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux or Cygwin on Windows).
## Questions to compute
- What are the Popular times of travel? (most common month, most common day of week, most common hour of day)
- What are the Popular stations and trip? (most common start station, most common end station, most common trip from start to end)
- What is the Trip duration? (total travel time, average travel time)
- What is the User info? (counts of each user type, counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago), earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
